<h1>Nicole's Movie List</h1>

<h2>Top Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Practical Magic</h3>

<p>This movie made me realize that I may have a little witch (or at least a desire to be one) inside of me.  It is also the movie where I got my daughter's name.  It is a movie about sisters and magic and love and has my favorite actress (Sandra Bullock) in it.</p>

<h3>Fool's Rush In</h3>

<p>This movie is about chances, coincidences and love.  Selma Hyack (another actress I love) believes in Fated meetings and Soul Mates.  It made me laugh and love and dream.</p>

<h3>Serendipity</h3>

<p>This movie is all about love and the connection you feel when you "just know" someone is right for you but maybe the timing isn't.  This movie allowed me to understand that love happens when it is supposed to, it has its own time table.</p>
